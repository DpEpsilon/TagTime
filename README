Core Perl implementation of TagTime itself is in the following files:

* tagtimed.pl -- the TagTime daemon
* launch.pl -- launches the pinger by popping up an xterm
* ping.pl -- prompts for the tags
* util.pl -- utility functions
* settings.pl.template -- user-specific settings

In addtion are the following files:

* install.py -- install script
* grppings.pl -- grep your tagtime log file
* cntpings.pl -- tally pings in your log file matching given criteria

* tskedit.pl -- task editor / to-do list that integrates with TagTime
* tskproc.pl -- helper script used by tskedit.pl
* tasks.vim.template -- vim macros needed for the task editor

* merge.pl -- just a stub, for fixing/merging tagtime logs

The aux directory contains various scripts we've used, like for various games
and contests and commitment contracts and whatnot. Basically, incentive schemes
for getting ourselves to procrastinate less.
